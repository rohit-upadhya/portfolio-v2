            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
            Searching for relevant infomration in a case law is one of the fundamental activities of a law professional. However, as one can image this is a very taxing work where numerous hours, (by some estimates over 30% of a legal professional's time) are spent to sift through these dense documents. Thus there is a need to have an advanced retreival system that accurately and efficiently, thus enabling legal professionals and lawyers to spend their time on more productive tasks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
            Legal information retreival (IR) presents various challenges. Firstly, legal text is extremely domain specific with very domain specific jargon that is not present in day to day language. Secondly, legal documents are distinctly complex having contorted argumentation presented in a structured manner. Thirdly, there is varied amount of structural dependemcy where one part of the document might attend to a completely different part of the same document, or different documents might cite and attend to another document altogether. Fourth, the legal landscape is quite dynamic and ever changing. Finally, with the globalization of legal practice, it becomes imperative that retrieval systems support diverse languages, especially in multijurisdiction settings. Courts spanning multiple countries such as ECHR, ICC, ICJ, PCA, ECJ, ITLOS, ECOWAS, AfCHPR, etc. as well as courts that have multiple official languages such as India, Switzerland, South Africa, Spain, etc. there is a need for a sophisticated retrieval systems that bridge language barriers, mapping queries and context across languages. Such legal systems not only have to understand the jargon and intricacies of legal documents, but also need to understand the nuances and variations between languages.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
            Legal IR has become quite important in the Legal Domain, where Lawyers need to find statues, presedents, and documents from vast repositories. This includes retrieving relevant legislation, prior cases, civil codes, and patents, among others. This research dealt with the issue of legal case retreival, specifically fine-grained paragraph retreival from a larger case document.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
            We presented three contributions to the legal domain as part of this research work. Firstly, we presetned a new dataset called LexCLiPR—A Legal Cross-Lingual Paragraph Retrieval dataset based on ECtHR judgements. This contains query-judgment pairs having queries in seven different languages mapped to English judgments. The dataset is presetned in GitHub, as part of HuggingFace dataset, and can also be played around in Kaggle. The queries are obtained from the concatenated section headers, while the relevant signal are obtained from the discussions that contain citations to the English ECtHR judgments. In addition, the dataset has been divided such that the systems being built on top of this dataset are able to generalize during the retrieval process.

            The queries were collected by highlighting the topics and subtopics of the articles, picking them up, and concatinating them to form one query. We also call them legal concepts. This is illustrated in {' '}<a href="#fig1" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 1</a> using the Turkish case law guide on Terrorism. Each of the section/subsection has explanation of what the (sub)section entails ({' '}<a href="#fig2" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 2</a>), and has citation to various previous judgements along with the particular paragraph that is of interest. We ontain the relevant judgements and paragraphs from here. Finally, after obtaining the cited judgements, we extract the same judgements from the{' '}<a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">HUDOC</a> public database ({''}<a href="#fig3" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 3</a>). The cited paragraphs under each (sub)section is taken as the paragraphs of relevance. So now we have our query collected from the sections and subsections of the Articles, the cited judgements from the explanation of the (sub)section, all the paragraphs pertaining to this judgements from HUDOC, and the cited relevant paragraph numbers from the artiles, while the paragraph itself as part of the extracted judgement from HUDOC. Our task is to accurately retreive these relevant paragraphs from all the paragraphs of the judgement, given a query.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8 text-justify">
                The LexCLiPR dataset has been divided into 2 parts-Seen and Unseen queries. The Seen-query split is a proxy for all the legal concepts that are already present in the domain, while the Unseen-query split represent all the concepts that might enter the domain at a later date. The Seen-query split is further divided into the train, val and test sets. The Unseen-query split is just used for testing the various models' capability to generalize to unseen legal concepts.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
                We applied three levels of methods to work with our LexCLiPR dataset.

            <h5 className="text-l font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-2">Zero-Shot Experiments</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
                The Zero-Shot experiments helped us to establish the capabilities of various Monolingiual and Multilingual LMs on task-specific and domain-specific data.  We made use of the BM25 Lexical method to establish a lexical baseline. Since our judgement paragraphs are all in English, we needed to translate the queries in languages other than English into English. For this we made use of <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">META’s NLLB-200</a> model. We use the following models to build our baselines on : <a href="https://www.huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">BERT</a>, <a href="https://www.huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">mBERT</a>, <a href="https://www.huggingface.co/facebook/dpr-ctx_encoder-single-nq-base" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">DPR</a>, <a href="https://www.huggingface.co/castorini/mdpr-tied-pft-msmarco" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">mDPR</a>, and <a href="https://www.huggingface.co/joelniklaus/legal-xlm-roberta-base" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline" target="_blank">mLegalBERT</a> models.

            <h5 className="text-l font-extrabold text-gray-900 mb-2">Fine-Tuning</h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 text-justify">
                With the fine-tuning experiments we look to establish the fact that fine-tuning a pretrined model on domain-specific data generally improves its capability of retreival. <a href="#fig4" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 4</a> describes the finetuning process. Since each query might have many paragraphs cited from a single judgement, we lable all these cited paragraphs as positive paragraphs, and the rest of the uncited paragraphs are labelled as negative paragraphs. For each positive paragraph we pick up seven negative paragraphs at random. This forms one iteration of our finetuning process. We pass these paragraphs and the query through an encoder pipeline, obtain the encodings of each of the paragraphs, and the query. We then apply cosine similarity between individual paragraph embeddings and the query. We obtain these results as our logits after a softmax function, and then apply contrastive loss to fine-tune our models.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3 text-justify">
                We used two different architectures for our encoder pipelines-Siamese and Two-Tower architectures. In the Siamese pipeline, we use one single model to encode both the judgement paragraphs and the query. We expect this architecture to perform better when we use translated queries. An illustration of this architecture is presented in <a href="#fig5" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 5</a>. In the Two-Tower architecture on the other hand, we have two separate encoders for the queries and the judgement paragraphs. This should ideally perform better on multilingual models. An illustration of this architecture is presented in <a href="#fig6" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 6</a>.

            </h5>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
                Fine-grained IR usually means that larger documents are chunked in order to produce finer grained texts, paragraphs, sentences, etc. This activity strips away the contextual information that is present between these chunks. Traditional IR methods ignore this contextual information, relying on the text itself to convey the necessary information. However, there is much contextual information present that is not taken advantage of. What we try to do as part of this research is to inhance paragraph representation using contextualization.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2 text-justify">
                We represent each paragraph as a node, and their relationships are modelled as the edges in the graph. We then apply graph-learning algorithms to enhance paragraph enbeddings. We use the encodings of the individual paragraphs as features of a node, and use message passing on these representations. We use a 3 layered GAT (Graph Attention Network) to perform the message passing procedure. Our underlying encoder is the mDPR, out of the box without any fine-tuning applied. We call this approach GAVEL: <strong>G</strong>raph-<strong>A</strong>ugmented <strong>V</strong>iews for Enriching Paragraph Representations for Retrieval in <strong>L</strong>egal Judgments.

                Now the obvious question arisis-how do we build these connections? Well there are various ways to do this. Ass part of this thesis we focus on two mothods-Local Method and Global Method. In the Local method, perform an n-hop to connect the paragraphs, where each paragraphs is connected to its previous and next n paragraphs. <a href="#fig7" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 7</a> illustrates a 2-hop approach. In the Global method, we try to obtain relevant infromation keeping in mind the global context of the document. We make use of BERTopic to perform topic-modelling and obtain relevant topics from each judgement. These topics are taken as additional nodes. BERTopic also returns the probability of how likely a paragraph belongs to a particular topic. We measure this and only connect the paragraph-topic pairs who's probability of being connected exceeds a particular threshold (in our case 0.30). <a href="#fig8" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Figure 8</a> illustrates this approach.

                For our main methodology, we apply these methods in unisen, that is, we make use of both local and global approaches to obtain a hollistic view of the document. We use the same judgements and obtain two different graphs-using local and global approaches, which are then passed into their won GATs. From these we obtain two sets of paragraph representations. We appennd corresponding updated paragraph embeddings. For example embeddings of paragraph 1 from the local approach pipleine is appended with the enbeddings of paragraph 1 from the global approach pipeline and so on. The topic embeddings from the global approach are discarded. We pass these appended embeddings thropugh a feed-forward network to return the embeddings to their original embedding size. These then follow the same process that was followed for the fine-tuning method, applying cosine similarity and constrastive loss.
